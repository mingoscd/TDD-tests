# SL5. Conway's Game of Life
# We now discovered that the amount of money in the bag only pays for a coffee, half muffin and a couple of Smints. So we realized that we still
# have to be developers in order to pay rent. Isn’t that great? :)
# This got ourselves thinking about Life, in capitals. How we are just particles in the Universe, and how the shitty end of Lost is not THAT
# important (though, JJ Abrams, SERIOUSLY?).
# Anyway, while we are philosophing about Everything, we end up discovering about Conway’s Game of Life. More information is in here:
